# Mediation algorithm

Using Composite pattern let us get very flexible mediation strategy with less code. 
We need to use only a few parameters.

For group:
* surveyType (enum CONSISTENTLY, CONCURRENTLY)

For unit:
* stopGroupIfLoaded (bool)
* fireCallbackIfLoaded (bool)


*See tests or create new for understanding.*
